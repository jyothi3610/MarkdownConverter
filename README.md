# MarkdownConverter

This is a conversion tool from markdown to html that converts a small set of markdown elements like headings, paragraphs, links etc. This takes a file input and processes the file content and converts it. One must provide the file path to convert it. If the file is not provided, then it uses the default file in the repository for conversion
